    "- Club data \n",
    "- Player data\n",
    "- Player history\n",
    "- Fixture data\n",
    "- My team data\n",
    "- Fixtures / gameweek multiplier\n",
    "- Previous season points (the previous season 'points per appearance has been added as gameweek 0 history)\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Create player score based on:\n",
    "- v1: total points & total points per million\n",
    "- v2: predicted points next gameweek / next 3 gameweeks and predicted points per million\n",

    "#### 4. Figure out a way to make transfer most efficiently to maximise my team score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimisation constraints:\n",
    "- My budget (start at Â£100 million but can go up and down based on player prices changing)\n",
    "- Fill a team of 15 players consisting of \n",
    "        - 2 x GKP\n",
    "        - 5 x DEF\n",
    "        - 5 x MID\n",

    "- 4 of these players will be subs and do not generate you gamepoints.\n",
    "- The 'starting 11' Can be of any combination/formation, providing 1 goalkeeper, at least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.\n",
    "- Only 1 free transfer can be made each week, further transfers deduct 4 points from your total points\n",
    "\n",

    "#### We want to Maximise:\n",
    "- Total points per player\n",
    "- Player score (points per million x fixture multiplier) x chance to play\n",
    "- Average points over next 3 gameweeks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caps\n",
    "- You are given a selection of boosts / advantages (called Caps) which you can play at any time, these are:\n",
    "        - 2 x Wildcards: Make unlimited free transfers to your team in a gameweek\n",
    "        - 1 x Free Hit: Same as above, but team reverts back to previous lineup after 1 week\n",
    "        - Triple Captain: Your captain scores you triple points for the next gameweek\n",
    "        - Bench Boost: The points from all your subs are included in your total score for the gameweek\n"
