    "1. Import the BeautifulSoup package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a BeautifulSoup object out of the webpage content and call it soup. Use \"html.parser\" as the parser. Print out soup! Look at how it contains all of the HTML of the page! We will learn how to traverse this content and find what we need in the next exercises."
