    "KDE plots are preferable to histograms because depending on how you group the data into bins and the width of the bins, you can draw wildly different conclusions about the shape of the data. Using a KDE plot can mitigate these issues, because they smooth the datasets, allow us to generalize over the shape of our data, and aren’t beholden to specific data points."
